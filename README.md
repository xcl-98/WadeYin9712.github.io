## About me
Hi, my name is **Da Yin**, an undergraduate student of Peking University.

My research interests lie in natural language processing, data mining, machine learning and computational social science. More specifically, I devote myself to sentiment analysis, natural language inference and information extraction.

I am supervised by Prof. [Kai-Wei Chang](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~kwchang/) in UCLA, Prof. [Xiaojun Wan](https://wanxiaojun.github.io/) and Prof. [Baobao Chang](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?hl=en&user=LaKNyhQAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) in Peking University. If you are interested, please don't hesitate to contact me!
